## Tooling used
- Disassembly / decompilation: IDA Pro, Ghidra, monodis (Mono IL Disassembler), Detect-It-Easy, x64dbg (with Scylla)
- Python 3: Emulator & solver scripts, keygens, custom PRNG prediction simulators
- Platform: Windows (x86/x64) and Linux/Mono runtime
- Network tools: Netcat (local TCP spoofing)

## Lessons / takeaways
- **Bob's Gambling Crackme** — Windows console binary; solved by abusing integer overflow / underflow logic inside the betting check.
- **Roullete Simulator** — Java class binary; solved by brute-forcing the 16-bit PRNG seed from ~20 bets to predict wins/losses and overflow the wallet balance.
- **ChocolateFactory** — 64-bit Windows console binary; solved by reconstructing a multi-stage validation algorithm and constraint solving.
- **MalwareTech VM1** — 8-bit custom Virtual Machine analysis; solved by extracting raw memory bytecode (`ram.bin`) and writing a Python VM emulator to reverse-engineer the XOR key logic.
- **CryMore** — TCP-based killswitch analysis; solved by setting up a local TCP socket using Netcat to spoof the expected response (`200 OK`) and neutralizing the logic path.
- **The Alchemist's Lock** — UPX/custom packer analysis; solved by dynamic unpacking in x64dbg, OEP dumping via Scylla, and binary patching the validation check.
- **Catgirl Crackme** — .NET assembly reversing; solved by static IL disassembly with Mono's `monodis` tool to identify the correct validation string while bypassing decoy strings.
